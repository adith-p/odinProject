    <ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>3 pounds baking potatoes</li>

        <li> 1 pound lean ground beef</li>

        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>

        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>

        <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans</li>

        <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning mix</li>

        <li> 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>

        <li>4 cups milk</li>

        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        <li>1 ½ cups shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>

        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>


        <li>chopped fresh chives (Optional)</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>step 1</h3>
    <p> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prick potatoes with a fork. Transfer to a 10x15-inch baking pan.

        Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until tender, about 1 hour.
    </p>
    <h3>step 2</h3>
    <p>

        Meanwhile, for chili, add ground beef, onion, and garlic to a large saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring to
        break up lumps, until meat is browned and onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain grease.</p>

        <h3>step 3</h3>
    <p>Add tomato sauce, chili beans, and chili seasoning mix to saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and
        simmer, covered, at least 10 minutes to let flavors meld.</p>
        <h3>step 4</h3>
    <p>When potatoes are cool enough to handle, use a spoon to scoop potato pulp into large bowl. (You should have about
        4 cups pulp). Discard skins. Add broth to bowl. Mash potatoes until smooth.</p>
        <h3>step 5</h3>
    <p>Melt butter in a 4- to 5-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook, whisking constantly to make a
        light roux, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk, 1 cup at a time. Cook, whisking constantly, until lightly
        thickened. Stir in potato mixture, buttermilk, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until heated
        through, 3 to 5 minutes (soup will be very thick). Remove from heat and gradually stir in 1 cup cheese.</p>

        <h3>step 6</h3>
    <p>Divide soup among bowls. Top with chili, sour cream, remaining 1/2 cup cheese, and chives (if using). </p>
